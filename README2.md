## Reflection:

Using GitHub's project management features, including milestones, issues, and project boards, significantly enhances team collaboration and project organization. Milestones provide clear objectives, helping the team focus on specific goals and track progress. Issues allow team members to document bugs, feature requests, and tasks, fostering accountability and transparency. The project board visualizes the workflow, making it easy to identify what needs to be done, whatâ€™s in progress, and what has been completed.

However, challenges may arise, such as ensuring all team members consistently update their tasks and maintain clear communication. Miscommunication can lead to duplicated efforts or overlooked tasks. To mitigate these challenges, regular check-ins and updates will be implemented, ensuring everyone stays aligned and on track.
